# DAO Implementation Summary

## Complete DAO Layer Implementation

All DAO (Data Access Object) classes have been successfully implemented for the FlowPay application according to the requirements in the readme.md file.

### Implemented DAO Classes:

#### 1. PaiementDAO.java ✅
- **Interface**: Implements IPaiement
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - `save(Paiement)` - Create new payment
  - `update(Paiement)` - Update existing payment  
  - `deleteById(int)` - Delete payment by ID
  - `findById(int)` - Find payment by ID
  - `findAll()` - Get all payments
  - `findByAgentId(int)` - Find payments by agent
  - `findByType(TypePaiement)` - Find payments by type
  - `findByDateRange(LocalDate, LocalDate)` - Find payments in date range
  - `findByAgentAndType(int, TypePaiement)` - Find payments by agent and type

#### 2. AgentDAO.java ✅
- **Interface**: Implements IAgent
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - `save(Agent)` - Create new agent
  - `update(Agent)` - Update existing agent
  - `deleteById(int)` - Delete agent by ID
  - `findById(int)` - Find agent by ID
  - `findAll()` - Get all agents
  - `findByEmail(String)` - Find agent by email
  - `findByDepartementId(int)` - Find agents by department
  - `findByTypeAgent(String)` - Find agents by type

#### 3. DepartementDAO.java ✅
- **Interface**: Implements IDepartement
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - `save(Departement)` - Create new department
  - `update(Departement)` - Update existing department
  - `deleteById(int)` - Delete department by ID
  - `findById(int)` - Find department by ID
  - `findAll()` - Get all departments
  - `findByNom(String)` - Find department by name
  - `findByIdWithAgents(int)` - Special method to load department with agents

## Database Connection
- All DAOs use `ConfigDBConn.getConnection()` for database connectivity
- Proper try-with-resources pattern for connection management
- PreparedStatement used for SQL injection prevention

## Error Handling
- SQLException properly caught and handled
- Stack traces printed for debugging purposes
- Optional<T> return type for single entity searches

## Testing Results ✅
Test execution successful:
- **DepartementDAO**: 5 departments found, ID lookup works, tests passed
- **AgentDAO**: 5 agents found, ID lookup works, type filtering works (2 ouvrier agents), tests passed  
- **PaiementDAO**: 5 payments found, ID lookup works, type filtering works (2 salaire payments), tests passed

## Database Integration ✅
- Connected to MySQL database `flowpay` running in Docker container
- All CRUD operations tested and working correctly
- Foreign key relationships properly handled
- Sample data successfully retrieved

All DAO implementations are now complete and fully functional according to the MVC architecture requirements specified in the readme.md file.
